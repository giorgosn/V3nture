## Description

This is an MVP for supporting founders and builders in finding their first customers and specifically into identifying a persona (customer segment) that is relevant for their venture. Just provide a short description of your venture and you will receive an email with the profile of one relevant persona. Also, you will rewarded with an NFT and a membership to v3nture DAO.
Identifying that one individual who decides to adopt your solution is crucial. Why? Because businesses aren't faceless entities; they're made of people. People with preferences, biases, and unique pain points. When we target companies or departments, we're shooting in the dark. But by focusing on the individual decision-maker, we tap into the very heart of what drives a purchase â€” emotion, need, and value perception. 
So don't just understand your product, understand the person who says 'yes' to it. Dive deeper, and tailor your approach to resonate with that persona. The payoff? A message that doesn't just reach its target, but sticks.
